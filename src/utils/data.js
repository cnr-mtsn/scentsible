      info:
        "Hi, my name is Rayne and I am the founder of Scentsible. I realized that each season, I went to the store and struggled to find clean burning candles that would be good for me and my family to burn around the house. I also loved to grab moisturizing, delicious smelling hand soaps for our bathroom and kitchen. One night it came to me that I am probably not the only one that does this and struggles to find products that are safe and sustainable. That's when I decided to create Scentsible. I promise to offer you the most eco-friendly, high-quality products I can find. I can't wait for Fall 2021 and if you subscribe I hope you get to experience the joy this box will bring.",
